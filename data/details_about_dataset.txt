 - The simulation used H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as backgrounds, which were not expected to harbor any fusion transcripts. 

 - The background dataset (2×75 nt) was downloaded from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession SRR066679, which was generated by the ENCODE Caltech RNA-Seq project (Birney et al., 2007; Raney et al., 2010). Datasets P2 was simulated based on SRR066679.

- Dataset contained 75 nt paired-end reads from 50 simulated fusion transcripts and they were mixed with the background reads. The number of reads generated per fusion depended on the RPKM values of the genes forming the fusion transcript, and their insert fragment size was equal to the median insert size in the corresponding background dataset.
